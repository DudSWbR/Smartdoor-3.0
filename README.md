## TL;DR

**Here is an example application with the following modern web technology stacks. With this boilerplate, you can easily start to build your own app.**

## Usage


## Motivation

Nowadays, I feel like **we need a wide range acknowledgment on web development even if we call ourselves "backend developer" or "frontend developer".**

As for my experience, I've been a Rails engineer, I'm but recently working like kinda frontend developer because I spend all of my working time for building an SPA (single page application) built with React + TypeScript.

The SPA, Of course, has a backend API, Ruby on Rails connecting PostgreSQL in my case. I use Docker Compose for defining and running multi-container Docker applications because it's not much simple to bootstrap all of applications and middlewares.

**Learning each technology itself is not a burden. I rather like learning. But I've thought I'd like to pursue my playground whose tech stacks are virtually same as ones I develop in work.**

## Further Details

### Backend

The combination, Rails + PostgreSQL + Docker Compose, is just a result I followed [Docker Compose's official instruction](https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/).

### Frontend

It consist of very thin webpack settings, TypeScript config, and Jest.
